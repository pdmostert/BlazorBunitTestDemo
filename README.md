# Blazor Bunit Test Demo

## Overview
This is a quick demo for doing unit testing with Blazor and using the Bunit Test library.
I have 2 unit test:
1. Test the Counter component - this is a simple test just to verify the coutner has changed.
2. Test the Wather componant - this was updated to use a Westherforcast Service as well as an Interface to allow for easyer testing. This test also shows how to manage injected services in the test.
